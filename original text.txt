The Celtics made seven consecutive 3s to start the fourth quarter, flipping a double-digit deficit at the beginning of the quarter into a lead they turned into a victory.
Boston stunned Golden State 120-108 in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday, and the Celtics pummeled the Warriors in the final quarter the same way the Warriors have buried so many teams over the years in the playoffs: with brilliant shooting and quality defense.
It was an unconventional win for the Celtics, too, with their best player, Jayson Tatum, scoring just 12 points on 3-for-17 shooting. Bostonâ€™s offensive versatility was on display.
